> # 俄罗斯卢布兑美元汇率跌至16个月低点
#### The Russian rouble has fallen to its lowest value for 16 months, falling past 100 per US dollar.  
> #### 俄罗斯卢布已跌至16个月来的最低点，兑美元汇率跌破100卢布。

The decline comes as pressure grows on the Russian economy, with imports rising faster than exports and military spending growing for the Ukraine war.  
> 出口下降之际，俄罗斯经济面临的压力越来越大，进口增长快于出口，乌克兰战争的军费开支也在增加。

Russia has been targeted with sanctions by Western countries following its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.  
```
targeted with ... 成为被...的目标
sanction n.制裁，处罚
invasion n.侵略，入侵
```
> 俄罗斯在2022年2月入侵乌克兰后成为西方国家制裁的目标。

The rouble plummeted after war first broken out, but was bolstered by capital controls and oil and gas exports.  
> 第一次战争爆发后，卢布暴跌，但受到资本管制和石油和天然气出口的支撑。

It has fluctuated in value since the war, but has lost about a quarter of its value overall against the dollar since Ukraine was invaded.  
> 自战争以来，卢布的价值一直在波动，但自乌克兰被入侵以来，卢布兑美元的汇率已经下跌了约四分之一。

Earlier on Monday, the rouble was 101.04 per US dollar. The most roubles per dollar means the currency is weakening, as it will take more of it to buy one US dollar, which is typically seen as the most powerful currency in the world.  
> 周一早些时候，1美元兑101.04卢布。1美元兑更多卢布意味着卢布正在走弱，因为需要更多卢布才能兑换1美元，而美元通常被视为世界上最强大的货币。

Russia's central bank has said that a key interest rate increase is possible, but maintains that it sees no threat to the country's financial stability.  
> 俄罗斯央行表示，有可能上调关键利率，但坚持认为不会对该国的金融稳定构成威胁。

When Russia invaded Ukraine the bank hiked rates from 9.5% to 20%, but began cutting them shortly afterwards.  
> 当俄罗斯入侵乌克兰时，欧洲央行将利率从9.5%上调至20%，但不久之后又开始下调利率。

Jane Foley, managing director at Rabobank London, said the rouble had been "weakening progressively" this year, but added "the pace has picked up since late July".  
> 荷兰合作银行伦敦分行(Rabobank London)董事总经理简•福利(Jane Foley)表示，卢布今年一直在“逐步贬值”，但她补充称，“自7月底以来，贬值步伐有所加快”。

"The weakness in the rouble reflects a warkening fundamental backdrop in Russia," she added, pointing out that the country's budget was in deficit and it was relying on imports from China and Turkey, but facing pressure over exports.  
> 她补充称:“卢布的疲软反映出俄罗斯的基本面正在减弱。”她指出，俄罗斯的预算处于赤字状态，依赖从中国和土耳其的进口，但也面临出口压力。

Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said that Russia's trade, and therefore its economy, was being hit by Western sanctions, "especially for oil and gas".  
> AJ Bell投资总监拉斯•莫尔德(Russ Mould)表示，俄罗斯的贸易以及经济正受到西方制裁的打击，“尤其是在石油和天然气方面”。

Since the outbreak of war, many EU countries which relied on Russian oil and gas have pledged to wean themselves off imports from country and find alternative suppliers.  
> 自战争爆发以来，许多依赖俄罗斯石油和天然气的欧盟国家已承诺不再从俄罗斯进口，并寻找替代供应商。

In December 2022, G7 and EU leaders introduced a price cap plan aimed at limiting the revenue Russia earns from its oil exports, by trying to keep it below $60 a barrel. This has played a part in the value of Russia's exports for oil dropping.  
> 2022年12月，七国集团和欧盟领导人推出了一项价格上限计划，旨在限制俄罗斯从石油出口中获得的收入，试图将其控制在每桶60美元以下。这在一定程度上导致了俄罗斯石油出口价值的下降。

Russia also turned off the gas taps to Europe, leading to fears of blackouts. In January, Germany, once a large importer, said it no longer depended on the country's fossil fuels for its energy supply.  
> 俄罗斯还切断了对欧洲的天然气供应，引发了对停电的担忧。今年1月，曾经的能源进口大国德国表示，它不再依赖该国的化石燃料作为能源供应。

"Exports are down, so hard currency inflows are down, and imports are up, and even reliable trading partners such as China appear reluctant to take roubles," said Mr Mould.  
> 莫尔德表示:“出口下降，因此硬通货流入减少，进口上升，就连中国等可靠的贸易伙伴似乎也不愿接受卢布。”

He added Russia's exclusion from Swift, an international payment system used by thousands of financial institutions, has also hit Moscow.  
> 他补充说，俄罗斯被排除在Swift之外也对莫斯科造成了打击。Swift是一个由数千家金融机构使用的国际支付系统。

But Mr Mould said that "rouble weakness must also be set against dollar strength", with the American currency "gaining ground against emerging currencies across the board".  
> 但莫尔德表示，“卢布的弱势也必须与美元的强势相对应”，因为美元“对新兴货币全面走强”。

He said this was partly due to strength in the US economy, which he said "is forcing the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in contrast to many emerging central banks, which are starting to cut (notably Brazil and Chile)".  
> 他表示，这在一定程度上是由于美国经济的强劲，他表示，美国经济“正迫使美联储(fed)加息，这与许多新兴市场央行(尤其是巴西和智利)开始降息形成了鲜明对比”。

"Higher returns on cash in dollars and lower ones in other currencies can increase the relative attractiveness of holding greenbacks, or assets denominated in them," Mr Mould added.  
> 莫尔德补充称:“美元现金回报率较高，而其他货币回报较低，可能会增加持有美元或以美元计价的资产的相对吸引力。”
